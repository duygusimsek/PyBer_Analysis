# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

### History

The previous analysis was performed on large datasets of the PyBer ride-sharing app. company. Several types of visualization charts were created to demonstrate the relationship between the city types, number of drivers and riders, total fares, and riders and drivers by city type. 

### Purpose of the Analysis

In this project, the same datasets were studied to analyze ride-sharing data by type of city and a multiple-line visual chart was created to represent the total weekly fares based on the city types.

The result of the analysis will help understand how data varies by city type and how these differences can be applied to improve company- decisions in the future.
